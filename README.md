## About The Project

This challenge is perfect if you're just getting started. The shift between the layouts will be a nice test if you're new to building responsive projects.

## Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Grid and Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow

## What I learned

One of my challenges for this was formatting this from the desktop version to a responsive mobile version by using media queries. I was able to complete this challenge by memory and some trial and error.

## Useful resources

No external resources were used on this challenge.
